                <h1>About Olympics</h1>
                <p>The Olympic Games are divided into two seasons, summer and winter. The Summer Olympics was founded 
                    longer, so the participation is wider. However, unlike the Summer Olympics events and teams have 
                    become saturated, the Winter Olympics are still accelerating development and growth.</p>
                <h1>About Participants of Countries</h1>
                <p>Fortunately, among the 12 countries I chose, there have been hosts of the Olympics in recent years, 
                    so we can clearly see from the number of participants that as the host, there will be an exaggerated 
                    increase in the number of participants.Nonetheless, for the still developing Winter Olympics, this 
                    increase is not so conspicuous.</p>
                <h1>About Comparison</h1>
                <p>It can be seen from the performance of various countries that there is a certain positive correlation 
                    between the participating projects and the number of awards. Only countries with certain economic 
                    strength will pay more attention to sports development. From per capita GDP and per capita health care,
                     we can see that they have a certain positive correlation with the number of participants. However, 
                     to my surprise, population and number of participants are negatively correlated, but this may also 
                     be due to the use of less data. If all participating countries are used, the correlation should be 
                     more obvious.</p>
                <h1>Forecasting</h1>
                <p>The participating teams and competitions of the Summer Olympics will tend to be gentle, and there will 
                    be no significant increase in each session. The Winter Olympics will maintain a certain growth trend, 
                    and more countries and teams will participate.</p>
                <p>
                    The number of participants in the Summer Olympics will slow down with the participating teams, 
                    while the number of participants in the Winter Olympics will continue to increase as the teams expand. 
                    As women participate more in sports, the ratio of men to women in the Olympics will eventually become 1: 1.
                    Undoubtedly, as the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics, the number of participants in Japan is bound to have 
                    an exaggerated growth.
                </p>
                <h1>Overall</h1>
                <p>As the economy develops, more and more countries and people will participate in the Olympics. The higher 
                    the national standard of living, the greater the number of national participants and the better the 
                    performance of athletes. As the host, they will get more opportunities to participate in the Olympic 
                    Games.</p>
